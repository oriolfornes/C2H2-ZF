This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/oriolfornes/C2H2-zf/blob/master/C2H2-zf.ipynb) aims at identifying the total number of Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-zf) proteins/domains in UniProt [reference proteomes of eukaryotes](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/Reference_Proteomes_2020_02.tar.gz) (one protein per gene) that are covered in the [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) a) in complex with DNA or b) not.

## Methods

### Results
- The total number of C2H2-zf proteins is **186703**
  - For human, the number is **762**
- The total number of C2H2-zf domains is **963553**
  - For human, the number is **7180**
- The total number of C2H2-zf proteins with a PDB structure is **136**
  - For protein-DNA complex structures, the number is **23**
  - For human, these numbers are **91** and **12**, respectively"
- The total number of C2H2-zf domains covered (*i.e.* with atomic coordinates) by a PDB structure is **331**
  - For protein-DNA complex structures, the number is **86**
  - For human, these numbers are **270** and **48**, respectively
- The total number of PDB protein-DNA complexes covering one or more C2H2-zf domains is **104** (see "protein-DNA complexes of C2H2-zf proteins")
  -For human, the number is **62**
- The total number of C2H2-zf proteins in UniProt reference proteomes of eukaryotes (one protein per gene) with one or more domains covered by a PDB protein-DNA complex is: 19", "and for human, the number is: 11".
